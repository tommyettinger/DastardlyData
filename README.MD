### Unity & Godot Game Engine Language Support

If you need to target both Unity and Godot, I would currently recommend netstandard 2.1 and C# 8. Unity is working on switching to MSBuild but I wouldn't expect it any time soon.

- *[Unity does not support all features of C# 9](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html), It does fully support up through C# 8 in versions marked with *.
- üü® instructions for adding nuget packages to a Unity project can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/gamedev/unity/unity-scripting-upgrade#add-packages-from-nuget-to-a-unity-project)
- üü® nuget package support in Godot 3.x was a little rough, expect to need to clear your build cache and restart the MSBuild server occaisionally
